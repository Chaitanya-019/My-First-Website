                        Having rejected by a lot of Applications it was my first call for an interview which took me 30 minutes to hear that you’ve been selected.

                    <p>
                        After sending the application to ISB for my winter internship, I haven’t received any response but later when I was just going on with my stuff, I received a call in the evening from ISB which I completely forgot about and was very much excited to hear that my skill set is perfectly aligned with a project that’s going on, and got selected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ISB has given me a great mentorship that helped me learn how the world works with such a big data. Me along with my team were assigned some of the best and creative tasks which took us weeks to solve. ISB has provided a great exposure to some of the best tools where we collected over 10 million articles for sentiment analysis. It was one of my great experiences in my journey where I’ve worked with a lot of cutting-edge technologies including Cloud Computing.

                        This Journey of 1000 miles started with a single step as a marketing team head at a start-up Qkres technologies (under Nirmaan) which provides necessary equipment for any research or any project.

                        After getting into IITM its a new experience every day. Being in second year of my B. Tech journey, and due to the start of pandemic it was always hard to meet new people every day. But being a student with a passion to learn about new things in any aspect of my life, I have applied to a marketing role at a start-up and got selected. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being a start-up, it gave me a great exposure to some of the core processes that run inside a company and started to learn a lot of new things. As said by Uncle Ben, “With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility”, being in the marketing team such a challenging part where I got to explore the market and help my team to come up with new ideas which had led to make 7 to 10 orders in a week.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I personally think the working in start-up is completely a new experience which we cannot get experience working at a big MNC.

                        IIT’s being the top institute of India, IIT Madras has its own place in creating some of the best problem-solving brains. IIT Madras has given me a completely new world to see which I would have never imagined.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being Metallurgy as a major, with a passion in computer’s I thought it would be really hard to get a chance to explore the digital side of world. But IIT Madras has provided a vast number of resources in form of electives to pursue my dreams. The most interesting part of my journey at IIT Madras is the amount of time it provided to explore the world and learn the stuff that you’re passionate about along with a lot of likeminded people who always tries to correct me and support me and come along with me. It’s been a remarkable experience, being a part of Saarang (IITM cultural fest), where I’ve got a chance to learn some of best practices in managing people and learned a great leadership skill. CFI (centre for innovation) at IITM is always my inspiration of any new tech.
